# Eedi-Mining Misconceptions in Mathematics (host by The Learning Agency Lab)

Develop an NLP model driven by ML to accurately predict the affinity between misconceptions and incorrect answers (distractors) in multiple-choice questions. This solution will suggest candidate misconceptions for distractors, making it easier for expert human teachers to tag distractors with misconceptions.

If a student selects the distractor "13," they may have the misconception "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order."

Tagging distractors with appropriate misconceptions is essential but time-consuming, and it is difficult to maintain consistency across multiple human labellers. Misconceptions vary significantly in terms of description granularity, and new misconceptions are often discovered as human labellers tag distractors in new topic areas.

Initial efforts to use pre-trained language models have not been successful, likely due to the complexity of the mathematical content in the questions. Therefore, a more efficient and consistent approach is needed to streamline the tagging process and enhance the overall quality.

This competition challenges you to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model driven by Machine Learning (ML) that predicts the affinity between misconceptions and distractors. The goal is to create a model that not only aligns with known misconceptions but also generalizes to new, emerging misconceptions. Such a model would assist human labelers in accurately selecting suitable misconceptions from both existing and newly identified options.

Your work could help improve the understanding and management of misconceptions, enhancing the educational experience for both students and teachers.
